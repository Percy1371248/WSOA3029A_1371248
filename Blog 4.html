               <h1 class="blogHeader">UI/UX and why the U matters</h1>

               <p class="blogPa">
                  Two of the most commonly misunderstood and conflated concepts in web and app design are UI design and UX design. 
                  Typically, they are put together in a single word,UI/UX design,and they seem to be describing the same thing from the surface.
                  I believe that these principles branch of from what Aaron Marcus called Metaphor design which came to being when computers began taking over. 
                  
                </p>
                <p class="blogPa">
                  The basic concepts,words and images by which data is easily recognized,interpreted,and remembered are metaphors.
                  Metaphors include the critical means by which command/control decisions are communicated and the status of all information and functions is portrayed. 
                  Since it is relatively simple and fast to convert electronic displays,these metaphorical techniques can differ widely across systems and change over time. 
                  The usefulness of metaphors can be accomplished by organizational associations(structures,groups,objects,attributes,i.e. nouns) or by operations (processes,algorithms,recipes,i.e. verbs)(Marcus 1998:129).

               <p class="blogPa">
                  This was the ideal way of designing the GUI,graphic user interface,of a computer at that time. Now we have UI and UX designers taking it a step further.
               </p>
                  
               <p class="blogPa">
                  The"UI"in UI design stands for"user interface".An application's graphical architecture is the user interface. 
                  It consists of the users clicking on buttons,the text they are reading,the pictures,the sliders,the text entry fields,and all the other things with which the user interacts. 
                  This involves the configuration of the screen,transitions,animations for the GUI and every single micro-interaction.
                  It is all necessary to design some form of visual feature,interaction,or animation(UX Planet 2019).It falls to UI designers to do this work. 
                  They are determining what the application would look like. 
                  Colour schemes and button shapes,the width of lines and fonts used for text,must be selected.UI designers enhance the appearance and feel of the user interface of an application(UX Planet 2019).
                 </p>
                  
                 <p class="blogPa">
                  While "UX" means "user experience".The experience of a user of the app is determined by how they connect with it. 
                  Is it smooth and intuitive or clunky and frustrating to experience? Does it feel reasonable to navigate the app or does it feel arbitrary? 
                  Does engaging with the app offer users the feeling that they are performing the tasks they set out to accomplish successfully or does it feel like a fight? 
                  The experience of the user is determined by how easy or difficult it is to communicate with the elements of the user interface generated by the UI designers(UX Planet 2019).
                  The device configuration and the features are defined by them.How it is structured and how all the elements connect to each other.
                  They design,in short, how the interface works. 
                  The consumer will have a good experience if it works well and feels smooth but a crappy user experience is likely if navigation is complicated or unintuitive(UX Planet 2019).
                 </p>
                  
                 <p class="blogPa">
                  The user interface integrates the knowledge and functions of computer-based products and provides a framework for the usability and commercial success of the software.
                  One of the key challenges in the design of the user interface is how to help the inexperienced user rapidly become proficient and ultimately become an experienced user without the pressure of the training aids that were helpful to the inexperienced(Marcus 1998:129).
