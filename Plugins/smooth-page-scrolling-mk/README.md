# MK_smoothScroll
###### v1.0.1

Very easy and lightweight smooth **Scrolling** library. Works in every browser but phones and tablets aren't supported yet.

Mainly focused for one-page websites. Easily attach class *mk_scroller_block* to the elements you want to act as pages (when scrolled, scroll is going to them) and thats it.

Becouse it is fully automatized library, its better to require it in the end of *body* tag to make sure it inicializates properly.
*No inicialization needed, it handles everything on its own.*

*note*
In the CSS you can enable the media query and set the desired pixels you want this library to stop working. Basically at those set pixels the circles will disapear and the page will behave like normal scrolling website, great for fully responsive designs.
