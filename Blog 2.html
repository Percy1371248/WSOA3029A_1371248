               <h1>The World Wide Web</h1>

               <p>
                  The world wide web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN in 1989. 
                  The world-wide web was designed to be a pool of human intelligence that would encourage partners to exchange their thoughts and all facets of a shared project on remote locations(Berners-Lee 1994:792).
                  The web was structured such that no significant or centralized improvements would have to be made if it were used separately by two initiatives, but the information could be seamlessly reshaped to reflect the current state of awareness(Berners-Lee 1994:792).
               </p>

                  W3 has come to represent a lot of items that can be separated. The concept of a world of knowledge without boundaries in which all objects have a relation through which they can be retrieved. The address system (URI) which, amid several different protocols, was adopted by the project to make this world possible.
                  A network protocol (HTTP) used by local W3 servers for performance and otherwise inaccessible functionality. HTML ,a mark-up language) that any W3 client wants to understand and is used to communicate basic items such as text, menus, and easy online support information over the net. 
                  A body of data that is open on the Internet using one of any of the things alluded to above(Berners-Lee 1994:793).
               </p>

                  Though it has achieved this and more it has raised concerns with its usage. 
                  Tim believes that while the web has provided opportunities, provided a voice to disadvantaged people and improved our everyday lives, it has also created opportunities for scammers, given a voice to those who preach hate and made it easy to commit all sorts of crime(Hern 2019).
                  He identifies three aspects that are creating problems on the web.(1) “deliberate, malicious intent, such as state-sponsored hacking and attacks, criminal behaviour and online harassment” (Hern 2019).
                  he argues that this makes the system weak. The second is when a platform creates "perverse incentives" that allow others to compromise the interests of consumers, such as ad-based revenue models that encourage clickbait commercially and the viral distribution of misinformation(Hern 2019) .
                  And the third is even more widespread: certain structures and programs that have been developed thoughtfully and magnanimously even contribute to negative effects, such as the "outrageous and polarized tone and content of online discourse(Hern 2019).
               </p>
               <p>
                  We still know surprisingly little about how the web works for a development approaching its fourth decade. 
                  The technical specifics, of course, are all set out there, in that initial paper submitted to CERN, and in the several updates accepted by Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web Consortium he formed to succeed him(Hern 2019).
                  But the social dynamics built on that technological underpinning are evolving so quickly and are so unpredictable that we need to reassess their legacy every year. Which implies that we are operating a never-ending battle, trying to evaluate the effects of new platforms and systems even as rivals launch their future replacements(Hern 2019).
                   The approach of Berners-Lee is liberal: a kind of web re-foundation, establishing a new set of laws, both legal and technological, to unite the world around a mechanism that can avoid some of the mistakes of the past 31 years(Hern 2019).
                  He believes this is a push for legislation” Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative, and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online.” (Hern 2019).
