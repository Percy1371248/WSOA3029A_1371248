                  If you had to ask an artist or designer what the phrase “The medium is the message” you would probably create conflict.
                  On any day, the artist would tell you that the medium is what you use to state the message you have for your audience. 
                 How can the medium be the message? that is like saying paint or a pencil on its own is the message. 
                 "The medium is the message" sums up a much broader principle of communicating as a term, which is that the medium in which we want to communicate carries as much, if not more, meaning than the message itself.(Gross 2011)

                  The suggestion that we prefer to dwell on the obvious was connected with Marshall McLuhan.
                  In doing so, the systemic improvements in our lives that are subtly made, even over long stretches of time, are widely overlooked. 
                  Many of its properties are pretty clear to us once we develop a new innovation-be it an invention or a new idea. 
                  Generally speaking, we know what it will do traditionally, or at least what it is supposed to do, and what it could do. 
                  We also know what the benefits and negatives might be. But it is often always the case when we look inward, after a long period of time and familiarity of the new innovation and find that there were certain consequences that we were totally unaware of at the beginning. 
                 We often call these results "unintended consequences," but a more precise definition may be "unanticipated consequences"(Federman 2004)

               <p class="blog3Pa">
                  Many of the unanticipated implications derive from the fact that in our community and culture, there are situations that we simply do not consider in our thought process .
                  These range from cultural or religious concerns and historical precedents, to relatively important effects in a series of experiences, through interplay with current conditions.
                  They all work quietly to impact the way we connect with each other, and with our culture at large. (Federman 2004)

               <p class="blog3Pa">
              
                The physical and social effects of designs or behaviours as they amplify or intensify current processes is what is being addressing here.
                The change of size or rate or pattern that of any tool or technology brings into human affairs is the message(Mchulan 1964:203).
                A typical example would be the world wide web, in which I discussed in further detail in my previous blog, has changed the way we live and interact with one another. 
               It allowed the creation of social media and other entities to help progress our lives. 
               Another way that helped me make sense of this phrase was thanks to the Netflix documentary called the Social Dilemma. 
               In this documentary various aspects of social media are addressed like Facebook. Facebook was created to communicate better with our friends, family, acquaintances and giving you access to meet more and new people but also how the platform has been used for the forces of ‘evil’ influencing their users according to what they want. 
               This was not the intended goal for Facebook, but it ended being a business model for them.
               Mchulan would argue that in actuality Facebook is a content of the world wide web rather it being a medium.
