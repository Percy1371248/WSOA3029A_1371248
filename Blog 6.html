            <h1 class="blog6H">Ethical Internet</h1>

            <p class="blog6Pa">
               Shani Orgad wrote an article called “The internet as a moral space: the legacy of Roger Silverstone” in tribute to Roger Silverstone in which she addresses some of his views on the internet and ethics.  
               Roger Silverstone has stressed the media as a critical component of daily life since his early work on television. 
               He has always maintained that the media is not an appendage to social , political , economic, and cultural structures and should therefore not be treated as an appendage, but instead that they are essentially Printed into these procedures(Orgard 2007:34).
               
            </p>
            <p class="blog6Pa">
               An important part of this world is the internet. With other media, technology , and social, cultural , political, and economic structures, it has many relations and interconnections. 
               It must therefore be understood and analysed as such: not as distinct from, but as deeply interconnected with, and simultaneously influenced and shaped by, the wider media climate(Orgard 2007:34).
               The internet is one of the instruments that make up this world and the way it is used by various actors may have negative or beneficial effects on the world it is part of.
                At the same time, the internet is impacted by the way other services are used, and it relies on it(Orgard 2007:35).
               
               </p>
               
               <p class="blog6Pa">
                  The way we use the internet as a part of our lives raises the question of ethics on the internet. Ethics on the internet is a very broad concept. 
                  It essentially refers to the study of the role that the internet plays in what philosophers call the growth of the good life, the kind of life we want for ourselves, the kinds of people we want to be for society above all. 
                  Is the internet playing a constructive role in the development of that kind of life or is it in any way hindering us? And under that umbrella, there are a lot of issues that fall. 
                  Everything from the role of social media in establishing human relationships, to privacy, to net neutrality, to the whole issue of who has and does not have access to the internet, to the creation of the environment of big data, the form of data collected, by whom and about whom, and for what purposes.( Markkula Center)
                  
               </p>

               <p class="blog6Pa">
                     Privacy is the biggest concern with the usage of the internet. what happens if a hacker hacks someone’s personal computer and leaks information, who gets held responsible for it? 
                     The hacker or the manufacture of the person device? There is no straightforward answer to that question at this early stage of the slow invasion of connected devices into our everyday lives. 
                     That is because there is no clear legal framework that will keep producers liable for crucial errors that are detrimental to others. 
                     As is always the case, technology has evolved much faster than laws and regulations(Waddell 2017)
                   
               </p>

               <p class="blog6Pa">
                  In an interview between Kaveh Waddell ,a former staff writer at The Atlantic, and Francine Berman, a computer-science professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a long time expert on computer infrastructure, they discuss issues raised on how we use the internet and better ways to improve the ethics of the internet.
                   Berman suggests how we begin creating an ethical framework for the internet. She believes that Innovators, corporations, the government, and the citizen have a common obligation to try to build and use a system that allocates obligation and transparency based on what benefits the public good(Waddell 2017)
                  
               </p>
               <p class="blog6Pa">
                  We have to be vigilant with legislation, because instead of getting in the way of things, we want to make sure we have careful legislation that support the public good(Waddell 2017).
                   The Internet of Things is just emerging, so it is an excellent time to explore.
                   You have a lot of devices and systems that exchange information, you have policy concerns, you have privacy problems if you think of a smart city or a smart grid or a smart house, or even an intensive-care ward.
                   This is a perfect time for us to start experimenting and gain some input on things that make sense(Waddell 2017).
                  
               </p>
               <p class="blog6Pa">
                  For a rule on anything you do not even know about, you cannot come out in full force, since it is unlikely to work effectively.
                   But in more circumscribed frameworks, we can now get a lot of knowledge.
                   And if we make it a priority and start looking at smart cities or smart buildings in that way, then we might have a chance to begin to create a sound governance and ethical framework for the Internet of Things organically(Waddell 2017).
