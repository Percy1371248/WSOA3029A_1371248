               <h1>The Library of Babel</h1>

               <p>
                  The Library of Babel is part of the series of short stories published in 1944 by Jorge Luis Borges.
                  It is about a large, almost infinite library that is continually expanding, containing every possible combination of language and experience(King 2019). 
                  Borges has written the library of babel as comparison to the universe being infinite and having a vast access to knowledge, knowledge we may not even be aware of.
                   Depending on which context one has read this text other entities can be compared to the library. 
                  Being in digital environment and reading this text one cannot help to think that Borges could be talking about the internet.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In the modern world , the internet might probably be the largest source of information. 
                  Can Borges’ library be compared with aspects of the internet?(King 2019).
                  In order to make a comparison between two subject matters an understanding of both sides needs to be established.
                  We begin by trying to understand the internet.
                  The internet is the larger network that helps corporations, states, universities, and other organisations to communicate to each other computer networks around the world. 
                  The effect is a mass of cables, devices , data centres, routers , servers, repeaters, satellites, and Wi-Fi towers that allow digital information and data to move around the world(Sample 2018)
               </p>
               <p>
                  It operates according to a set of accepted protocols, the Control Protocol, and the Internet Protocol. The information consists of the number of protocols being used, the sender's IP address and the recipient's IP address(King 2019). 
                  Tim Berners-Lee, who had democratic values in mind, created the internet. He wished to decentralize the internet, where no central authority will post anything on the internet, which also refers to freedom from censorship and surveillance. 
                  Bernes-Lee wanted the internet to be free of prejudice and everyone must be on the same level. He referred to this principle of equality as net neutrality(King 2019). In addition, completely democratic standards would regulate the internet. 
                  Anyone could write code for websites instead of the code being written by a distant community of experts. Finally, the internet would be inclusive as well; it would be available to all people, irrespective of their customs, their cultures, and the applications they use. 
                  It would be possible for different communities to interrelate and genuine diversity would thrive(King 2019).
               </p>
               <p>
                  It is believed that the library has a copy of every book ever written. Supposedly, with all the letters in the alphabet, it contains every possible combination, and its combinations are almost endless(King 2019). 
                  The workings of Borges’ library will be compared to the algorithms of the internet.
                  The library is of such excellence, in the case of Borges, that it is of supernatural origin: It can only be the work of a God (Borges 1944:113). 
                  There are librarians in the library, but they are fallible .  The internet, meanwhile, is clearly man-made, but it uses systemic networks that transcend human fallibility(King 2019). 
                  Indeed, Borges says that the library has the concepts of precise, fragile, deeply dark, inimitable symmetric(Borges 1944:113), which mirrors the kind of algorithms adhered to by the internet.
                  Like the fallible users of Babel 's library, internet users are flawed and misuse the ideals suggested by Bernes-Lee. Although the values are accurate, the library ends up creating books full of pure gibberish(King 2019).
               </p>
                <p>
                  some of the books are disorganized, random, formless (Borges 1944:114). 
                  There are some books kept in the library that only consist of combinations of the letters MCV. While the books are largely meaningless, they often contain something understandable (Borges 1944:114). 
                  However, they are largely meaningless: There are leagues of foolish cacophony, of verbal farragoes and contradictions(Borges 1944:114). 
                  These books do not seem to be completely random, since they consist of the same letters, and in them the librarians tend to search for significance. Indeed, in the books, the librarians acknowledge patterns: Each letter might impact the next (Borges 1944:114).
                  This is analogous to internet bots, which end up creating gibberish. These internet bots are software that performs an automated job on the internet(King 2019).
               </p>
               <p>
                  Although the library and the internet are vast, every book in the library and every page on the internet is different. Borges writes: "In all languages, everything can be articulated" (Borges 1944:115), meaning that the library understands any possible aspect.
                   In spite of this, every single book in the library is different: There are no two similar books in the entire vast library (Borges 1944:115). 
                   This is similar to the internet, as each page has a different URL . One page is distinguished from other pages by each URL. In addition, Internet pages are written by people who all have distinct DNA. 
                   This is analogous to Babel 's library, as Borges points out that the same orthographic symbols make up each book (Borges 1944:115).
                    Each person produces the content of each individual page on the internet, with his own strand of DNA. There are billions of users and, yes, since it consists of 4.45 billion pages with its own individual URL, the internet is indeed huge (King 2019).
